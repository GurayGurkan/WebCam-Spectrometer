![PNG](Spectrometer.png 'A screenshot')

A real-time spectrometer application for visible (400 - 700 nm) range. The image capture is realized via Logitech C270 Webcam and a specific portion is cropped. Cropped area depends on the slit size, defraction grating material and the length of the dark tube that light travels in.
